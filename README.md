# Owin.Security.Providers.Bungie
OAuth provider for the Bungie.net API using OWIN

If you prefer to not have to build the source code but would rather just use the assembly in your code you can download the compiled assembly from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Owin.Security.Providers.Bungie/).

I am currently in the process of writing up some documentation as well as providing a basic sample ASP.NET MVC site that can be used in conjunction with the OAuth provider for debugging and learning how to interact with the Bungie API via OAuth.  I will provide a sequence diagram of the OAUth process with Bungie based on [RFC 6749 - The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749).

For now you can see the sequence diagram and I will fill in specific details around it.
